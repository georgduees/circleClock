-  [ ] PIR-Sensor SR505 with a 1cm diameter for Motion Detection
-  [ ] LDR-Sensor for brightness and Nightmode
#### LED
-  [ ] APA102C 30LED/m Strip 2m.
#### Arduino Uno / ATMEGA 328 
-  [ ] Computing
#### Clock
-  [ ] RTC DS 1307
-  [ ] DCF77 Receiver

#### Input
-  [ ] EC11 Rotary Encoder 

#### USB:
-  [ ] USBC Cable 3M: https://www.amazon.de/Ladekabel-Textilkabel-Datenkabel-Computer-Smartphones-Schwarz/dp/B01N20JIOU/ref=sr_1_2?s=ce-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1515506069&sr=1-2&keywords=usb+c+3.1+3m
